Our first object constructed was a wooden food puzzle inspired by an abacus. The object has bamboo bars with holes for food, and wooden rings that can be moved to reveal the food. This object was designed to offer a puzzle and a reward for food acquisition, specifically for the macaws. The second object build was a wooden perch with a block chain toy. The purpose of this object was to create a place where birds could perch, maintain their beaks, and widen their choices of areas they can be. The macaw object was placed near their enclosure, and the ""treehouse sanctuary"" was placed high in a separate tree. ",Excellent,Excellent,Excellent,Excellent,Excellent,"The beginning was the most challenging because we had trouble narrowing down ideas and combining elements that we preferred. I think my group spent a little longer idea ideating than other groups, and at times it was difficult to maintain focus. It is easiest to create something when you are excited and passionate about it. ","The most successful part of the design process for my group was construction. Typically in group work, production among members is variable. However, both my group members worked hard every day, and were happy to take on any task. ",Somewhat,"More information from the zoo about bird species, size, behavior, and common areas of habitation. ",Excellent,Excellent,Excellent,Excellent,Good,"Someone came in to work independently once and did a task out of order, but we were able to solve the issue.","Begin every day with a plan of action, and what you would like to complete. Note how many people are needed for each task and delegate. Make sure all the tools and equipment needed is present.

This is encouraged by the food at the top of the structure being attached to a rope with a counterweight, so the komodo will have to ascend the structure, grab the food, and pull against this weight by using its muscles and securing itself on the structure.",Excellent,Good,Excellent,Excellent,Good,Fabrication of our enrichment item was very difficult considering its size.  Trying to make an item that was large forced us to consider the convenience of transportation and effective use of materials to reduce the cost.,Creating a model and visualizing how our enrichment item was very helpful as it determined which goals were achievable and provided a rough idea of how we would construct such an item.,Yes,,Good,Good,Excellent,Excellent,Good,"Having to create many components by hand instead of buying ones already made was very challenging and added a lot of time to our construction process.  However, this was a valuable lesson in learning how these things are made and better enlighten us on effectively using our time and how to streamline construction processes.","I think having more strict deadlines would make the process more demanding, however it would certainly help keep all groups at an equal pace and discourage these projects being done last minute.",80,"""Plan until you can't plan anymore"", many parts of our project involved figuring things out as we were mid-fabrication, so being prepared for these changes beforehand instead of having to do so in a later stage makes the project a lot less complicated and minimizes extra time spent on it.","With the scale of our project, maybe having another group member on top of the four that we were could have been helpful.  We were really working on one component at a time when fabricating this object, so maybe considering more group members when understanding the scale of the project could have been helpful."

","The ideation gave us a really good framework to work with by helping us stay on track and knowing what to prioritize when completing the project and for what reason each of the elements our project were there. ",Yes,,Good,Excellent,Excellent,Good,Good,"Mostly time constraints, we underestimated how much time it would take to comeplete one of our logs and we wanted to do two and wanted to add a lot more surfacing but the actual construction took longer so we had little time for aesthetics ","I think my group was excited about working on the prototype since it turned out great. And cut our time down for construction. I think in general the process was great but maybe more guided group check ins to show what we had and talk out loud about the next steps to be able to stay on track and manage our time better. ",86,"This is for me personally but I would have liked to assert myself a little more. At times I felt like I was at disadvantage because I hadn’t taken a sculpture class in a really long time, so I was afraid of giving my opinion too much and wasting people’s time. So for the future I would say to be sure of myself and my ideas because they are just as valuable. For the group I would say to focus on time management and take risks. I would say that we started doing a lot of experiments because we were afraid to waste our materials because they were limited at the beginning. ","This class was an amazing and fulfilling class to go through the process in general. At the beginning, if I remember correctly the ideation of projects was handed out at random, I think that if we had chosen the animals more passionate ideas could have come out. Either way, it was a long process between ideation and realistic sketching so I don’t know that it really made a difference. "

This narrowed down what we needed to get done rather than focusing on the big picture or small details we wanted to include in our design.

I think this class could benefit from having two professors or a TA/GA/dedicated person to help in the lab so time can be used more effectively and Rob is not spread so thin.

Also maybe have less objects being made and have the whole class focus on one or two super ambitious objects that document data and still do intended enrichment.

This will be a very fun and rewarding project, though, and you’ll learn a lot from it. ","Overall this class and project were very challenging but such a fun process. I enjoyed working with teammates to brainstorm and push through creative and logistic roadblocks, and I would happily do it again. Going to the zoo and seeing the animals was also super cool. One thing I do recommend is maybe going to the zoo a bit sooner, I didn’t feel that the ball got rolling until our first visit where we could really visualize the object in the space and how the animals might interact with it."

Another was making sure we found an idea that could be created that would be safe for the animal. ","Probably the use of materials we decided on and the pattern were most successful.

",Yes,,Good,Excellent,Excellent,Excellent,Excellent,It was hard to create a good prototype because we didn’t have access to any of the actual materials we wanted to use and making it on a small scale with the real materials would have been pretty complicated.,Spend a little less time prototyping and a bit more on the making because there will be unexpected problems. At least that’s what I saw from other groups.

1. overestimating the weight of our materials, which we had hoped would float during our ideation.
2. surfacing our exterior log with wood stain before learning that oil based surfaces would reject the tarbender liquid epoxy. We lost some time working with mineral spirits and steel brushes to strip the stain away before resurfacing with acrylic paint.","At times our group felt stuck in the modeling phase and I believe we spent more time working with cardboard than necessary. I think we might have benefitted from expediting the modeling phase, or perhaps focusing our attention less on appearance and more on the practical aspects of our project such as locking mechanisms, criteria for floating, etc.",80,"If I could go back in time, I would have liked to stress to myself to look ahead as much as possible and begin demoing sculpting, drilling, and surfacing techniques much sooner.","Thank you for this wonderful opportunity!
